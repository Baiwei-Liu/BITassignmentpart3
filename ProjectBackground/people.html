                I come from China. I came to Australia in 2019 and I finished my diploma of IT last year in RMIT.
                I think I have a basic understanding of information technology. Some computer games or mobile phone apps will make me interested in their development.
                As a result, I am passionate about design and development. My strong point in terms of it is website design and weak points are Java code and database.
                So I need to practise java code and database design more to improve myself through this course. As for the contribution in this group, I hope I can do the website design part.
                As a team member, I will try my best to help my group complete this project and communicate with team members in time.

                I have been studying in Australia for 5 years,
                I came to Australia in 2015 to attend a language school for half a year and then study in high school in 2016,
                so I'm good at writing analysis, my nationality is China.
                I’m very interested in Information technology and I love to explore the information about mobile phones.
                My passion in IT is to learn new products, new ideas, new methods, I’m willing to learn and explore these new technologies.
                My strong point on IT is to use html/css to make a website, my weak point on IT is programming.
                It's hard for me to make an application use Java, but I believe I can carry on and overcome these problems. I can contribute to our team by writing analysis about the project and making a web page.
                I can also challenge myself to use the Java programming language to contribute to our team, that can also help me learn more about Java.

                My name is Xin Lin, you can call me Lynn.
                I am from China, and I came to Australia to study in 2018.
                Before that, I finished my international business studies in China.
                Then I worked for a year. I found that I was not interested in business, and then came to Australia to continue my study.
                This is my second year of studying information technology. I just graduated from the Diploma of Information Technology last year.
                In the process of learning IT, I think I am good at web programming, and I am very interested in it.
                In terms of database and Java, I think it needs to be improved.
                I will do my best in this team project, work hard with the team members, and learn the aspects I am not good at.

                My name is Yi Tao Ma, 'Ethan' is my English name, I am from China and I immigrated to Australia in 2016 and have studied in Australia since ninth grade and finish my year 12 in 2019.
                Chinese is my first language and unfortunately, I cannot celebrate most Chinese traditional festivals due to the long distance from Melbourne to China: 8463 km.
                Which also makes me miss a lot of delicious Chinese food. Indeed, I missed my home country, but I also try to fit in Australia, learn Australian cultures and many others.
                I believe I will be fine during the life of RMIT and Australia. I started to learn how to play the piano when I was 5 years old and I passed the piano level 10 examination.
                Sometimes I still play the piano to make sure I do not forget the piano skills. I also love to cook some traditional Chinese food: Fried Noodles/Rice etc.
                You know it is well to have some cooking skills to ensure you can keep yourself away from the starving. I often learn about the history of some computers and different kinds of programming.
                I think the code is very interesting because when I complete a complete program, I will experience an incomparable sense of accomplishment.
                Today's world life is inseparable from it, it involves many fields, learning it can let me in the future in a better society.
                Although the code and its knowledge are boring, it is the basis of the whole world, so I am still passionate about it.
                My weakness is java programming and databases, but it is not very weak. I can only say that I am not very skilled.
                I will work harder to master my weakness this semester, and I believe it will become better.
                I hope to play the role of web programming and Research (writing) in the project. Of course, it can also help to do some Java and database work.

                I was inspired by Steve Jobs who gave me the passion for mobile phone and mobile application.
                My strong points are coding, editing videos and some html designing. My weak points are database and algorithm implementation.
                I would like to develop my database skills through this course.
                Like all of the members in our group, the challenge is to cooperate with teammates and present a good project.
                To contribute to this team, I can do the coding stuff and probably give some advice on how we can improve our project.

                My main role in this project was to work on the online game page for our gaming website project.
                This role involved creating the online game itself and coding the function of generating coupon code for the project innovation according to our specifications.
                In addition to this role, I have also been working on the html base design for assignment part 1, part 2 and part 3
