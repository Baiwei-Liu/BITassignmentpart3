            <li>What have you learned about group projects?
                What has worked well in your group? What hasn’t worked well?
            </li>
            <p>After working together for 12 weeks, something we have learned about group projects are as below:</p>
            <p>
                <b>Team role:</b> It’s important for each team member to understand their role, which will greatly improve work efficiency. And also team members know what they need to do and what they can contribute to the team can make a big difference in completing the project.
            </p>
            <p><b>Time management:</b> As a group of six members, we have learned to manage the time for meetings and completing the project, especially when there are lots of other assignments due dates coming in, and also there are time differences between our teammates. </p>
            <p>As a group, our collaboration worked very well, we shared documents, github repository, figma and etc., everyone is doing their job efficiently. Once any issue occurs,  members will post their questions in the group channel and other members will quickly respond to the questions to give advice or solution.</p>
            <p>As mentioned above, the major thing we have not done well is time management. Everytime we will delay the completion of each assignment until the deadline, and the progress of the project has not started as early as planned, which these frequent delays have also led to the lower grade of assignments. This may be due to the time difference between members and everyone has been busy doing other assignments. However, we have to work better on time management, which we can plan earlier and complete the assignments or project earlier to prevent this issue from happening.</p>
            <li>What were the group processes for communication?
                How effective were they?
                Have there been any changes since the start of the semester?
            </li>
            <p>As the course requirement, the main method of group communication was through the Microsoft Teams. In Microsoft Teams, we have been allocated to a private group channel where the weekly meetings and communication. After 12 weeks of using the Teams, we found it efficient to use Teams for group cooperation especially when we have meetings every week, and the message notification also makes sure we would never miss out on messages from each other. As a team we found this method of communication stayed consistent throughout the semester.</p>
            <p>Another platform of communication we used is Trello, which used for keeping track of tasks and due dates. We think it is clear to show what each member is doing and what we have done. Also, this method of communication stayed consistent throughout the semester.</p>
            <li>From your experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organising a project of this nature?
                Is there anything that you would do differently if you were to start again?
            </li>
            <p>One of the most important aspects of organizing such a project is team communication. Each member must be 100% sure of his / her assigned work and complete it effectively. The foundation of teamwork is team communication. Members share and report their own problems or other members' problems, which can effectively improve efficiency and solve problems through collaborative discussion. If I start again, I will pay more attention to the analysis of questions and the depth of answers. In other aspects of team cooperation, I will suggest frequent reports. No matter the difficulties encountered, problems found, or suggestions, I can let the team members know. In this way, I believe that the efficiency of the project will be faster and the quality will be better.</p>
            <p></p>
            <li>What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project?</li>
            <p>It's important to communicate well with the team. There has always been Plan B so that when some members of the league are missing or unable to complete their part of the work within the specified time, plan B can be implemented so that they can spend their time safely. Second, understand the strengths of team members so as to better distribute the work, so that you can get twice the result with half the effort. Help your team members, if they encounter some problems, listen to their suggestions and improve, and finally manage the time and deliver your work within the specified time.
